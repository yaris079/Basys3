2014.2:
 * Version 5.1 (Rev. 3)
 * Disabled unnecessary assertions which triggered incorrectly when low latency serial dividers were simulated.  No functional changes.

2014.1:
 * Version 5.1 (Rev. 2)
 * C models for Windows are compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes
 * Netlists created by write_verilog and write_vhdl are IEEE P1735 encrypted, with keys for supported simulators so that netlist simulation can still be done
 * Enable third party synthesis tools to read encrypted netlists (but not source HDL)
 * Support for Virtex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status
 * VCS version H-2013.06-sp1 may cause errors or mismatches between behavioral sim and post- netlists. VCS version I-2014.03-Beta1 or later is recommended.

2013.4:
 * Version 5.1 (Rev. 1)
 * Clock constraint removed from supplied out of context xdc file for cases with no registers
 * ACLKEN and ARESETN disabled and set to false on GUI when Latency is set to 0
 * Support for Kintex Ultrascale devices at Pre-Production Status

2013.3:
 * Version 5.1
 * Addition of LUT-Mult architecture
 * Addition of configurable latency to Radix 2 architecture
 * Addition of C model
 * Internal standardization in source file delivery, does not change behavior
 * Support for Automotive Artix-7, Automotive Zynq, Defense Grade Artix-7, Defense Grade Zynq and Lower Power Artix-7 devices at Production Status
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators
 * Added default constraints for out of context flow
 * Added support for IP Integrator
 * Removed C model dependency on stlport (STL Portability) library; C model now uses STL built into the compiler
 * Windows C model DLLs are statically linked to the Windows C run-time (CRT) library, to remove the runtime dependency on MSVCRT90.dll, which can cause problems when using the C model in a Windows compiler other than Visual Studio 2008
 * C model updated to use third-party library MPIR version 2.6.0 (previously was version 2.2.1); the Windows MPIR DLLs are also statically linked to the Windows CRT library, to remove the dependency on MSVCRT90.dll

2013.2:
 * Version 5.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Support for Series 7 devices at Production status
 * Beta support for future devices
 * Removing support for Defense Grade Low Power Artix7

2013.1:
 * Version 5.0
 * Native Vivado Release
 * There have been no functional or interface changes to this IP.  The version number has changed to support unique versioning in Vivado starting with 2013.1.
